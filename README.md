# **CS342 Networks Lab ‚Äì Network Protocol Analysis & Simulation**

**Duration:** Aug 2024 ‚Äì Nov 2024  
**Course:** Computer Networks Lab  



## **üìù Overview**
This repository contains implementations and simulations of essential networking protocols and systems conducted as part of the Computer Networks Lab. The focus is on **real-time system design, network protocol analysis, and routing stability**, combining practical programming with simulation-based insights.  



## **üíª Projects & Implementations**

### **1. Real-Time Drone Control System**
- Developed a **multithreaded C++ system** for real-time drone operations.  
- Enabled **low-latency command execution**, **reliable telemetry**, and **secure file transfers**.  
- Utilized **encrypted QUIC** for **high-performance and secure communication**.  

### **2. Network Protocol Simulation**
- Simulated **Ethernet (CSMA/CD)** and **Wi-Fi (CSMA/CA)** protocols using **ns-3**.  
- Analyzed **throughput, latency, and collision metrics** under different network scenarios.  
- Provided insights into **protocol efficiency and network behavior**.  

### **3. Distance Vector Routing (DVR) Simulation**
- Implemented a **C++ DVR simulator** with:  
  - **Link failure recovery**  
  - **Poisoned Reverse**  
  - **Split Horizon**  
- Ensured **stable and loop-free routing** across dynamic network topologies.
